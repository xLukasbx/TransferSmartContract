# Transfer Smart Contract
This is a smart contract proof of concept based on Stratis blockchain platform

# How it works
The smart contract takes funds with minimal value which is declared as of constructor parameters. For example when you define value, let's say 10, in constructor param during deploying contract , then smart contract catchs only funds more than 10

# Components to run smart contract
If you want to deploy this smart contract on your computer locally, you have to download [Stratis Bitcoin Full Node](https://github.com/stratisproject/StratisBitcoinFullNode/tree/sc-alpha-latest) and [.Net Core framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1) and transfer smart contract of course
